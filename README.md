# Doubletap
### A very loud but fast recon scan and pentest template creator for use in CTF's/OSCP/Hackthebox...

```
To install just run the setup.sh (chmod +x setup.sh), alternatively you can run my forked version of 

g0tmilk's os-script for Kali 2.0. This will set all the requirements as well -->

https://github.com/benrau87/os-scripts/tree/master


This script will be stored under /opt/doubletap-git and the pathing will be set after reboot

If needed, you can change the template folder output location and default interface in doubletap.py

Just run doubletap-git 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 ... 

Any other issues just Google it, Mike

Enjoy!

**PS - obviously don't use this were you don't have permission
