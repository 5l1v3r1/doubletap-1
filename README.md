# doubletap
### A very loud but fast recon scan and pentest template creator for use in CTF's/OSCP/Hackthebox...

```
To install just run the setup.sh, alternatively you can run my forked version of 

g0tmilk's os-script for Kali 2.0. This will set all the requirements as well

This script will be stored under /opt/doubletap-git and the pathing will be set

If needed you can change the template folder output location and default interface in doubletap.py

Enjoy!

**PS - obviously don't use this were you don't have permission
```
